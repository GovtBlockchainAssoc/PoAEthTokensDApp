# PoAEthTokensDApp
Currently includes an PoA Ethereum faucet and a token transfer function capable of transferring from Ethereum to Steem as well as within the PoA Ethereum blockchain (see SteemGateway for details).

Will shortly enhance the token transfer function to allow transferring to the Ethereum main net and the test nets.
